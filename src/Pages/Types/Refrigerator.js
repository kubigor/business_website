    <h2>Common Refrigerator Problems and Their Causes</h2>
    <h3>1. Refrigerator Not Cooling Properly</h3>
    <p>Common causes include dirty condenser coils, a malfunctioning evaporator fan motor, thermostat failure, or compressor issues.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Check the temperature settings, clean condenser coils, and inspect the fan. If the issue persists, contact a professional refrigerator repair service.</p>

    <h3>2. Refrigerator Leaking Water</h3>
    <p>This could be due to a clogged defrost drain, a cracked water inlet valve, or a loose door gasket.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Inspect the defrost drain and clear any blockages. If the water inlet valve is damaged, it may need replacement.</p>

    <h3>3. Refrigerator Making Loud Noises</h3>
    <p>A humming, buzzing, or clicking noise may indicate a failing compressor, loose fan blades, or clogged condenser coils.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Unplug the refrigerator and check for any debris around the fan or condenser coils.</p>

    <h3>4. Ice Maker Not Working</h3>
    <p>Possible causes include a frozen water line, faulty water inlet valve, or a defective ice maker module.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Check if the water line is frozen and defrost it if necessary. If the issue persists, an expert in refrigerator ice maker repair can help.</p>

    <h3>5. Refrigerator Freezing Food</h3>
    <p>If your fridge is too cold, it may be due to a faulty thermostat, blocked air vents, or a defective temperature control board.</p>
