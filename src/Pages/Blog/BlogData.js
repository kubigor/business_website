      par1: `    <h1>Troubleshoot a Dryer: Step-by-Step Guide</h1>

    <h2>Check the Plug</h2>
    <p>If your dryer won't start, ensure it’s plugged in. Plugs can get loose due to movement, fallen objects, or even pets. A quick check can save you a lot of trouble.</p>

    <h2>Check the Breaker or Fuse</h2>
    <p>If the dryer is plugged in but still won’t run, check your home's electrical box for a blown fuse or tripped circuit breaker. Replace the fuse or reset the breaker if needed. Verify the outlet's voltage with a voltage meter. For gas dryers, make sure the pilot light is on and there’s enough gas supply.</p>

    <h2>Inspect the Fuse, Switch, and Belt</h2>
    <p>If everything seems fine but the dryer still doesn’t work, consider these steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Thermal Fuse:</strong> A power surge or overheating can blow the thermal fuse. This fuse is inexpensive and easy to replace.</li>
        <li><strong>Door Switch:</strong> Dryers won’t work if the door switch is broken or dirty. Clean the contact areas with a cotton swab and rubbing alcohol.</li>
        <li><strong>Rubber Belt:</strong> If the drum doesn’t turn but the dryer heats, check the belt connecting the motor to the drum. Replace if loose or broken.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Check the Temperature Sensor</h2>
    <p>A dryer that turns on but shuts off quickly might have an issue with the thermostat or thermal resistor. Check these components with a voltage meter. Refer to the user or repair manual for guidance.</p>

    <h2>Search for the Source of Unexpected Noise</h2>
    <p>If your dryer makes clanging or knocking noises, check inside for loose objects like coins, keys, or unzipped clothing. If it’s still noisy or vibrates, level the dryer. Screeching or squealing noises often indicate worn drum bearings or supports, which may require professional repair.</p>

    <h2>Clean the Lint Filter</h2>
    <p>A full lint filter can cause longer drying times and lint-covered clothes. Clean the filter thoroughly, removing any dryer sheet residue. Clean the electronic moisture sensors inside the drum with rubbing alcohol for better efficiency.</p>

    <h2>Inspect the Dryer Vents</h2>
    <p>If your dryer heats but takes too long to dry clothes, check the vent system for kinks, clogs, or disconnections. Use a long-handled brush or leaf blower to clean the vent. Replace any flexible white plastic dryer hoses with a rigid vent to prevent fire hazards. Check the outside vent regularly for lint buildup.</p>

    <h2>Read Through the Manual</h2>
    <p>If troubleshooting doesn’t resolve the issue, consult the dryer’s manual for model-specific tips. If you don’t have the manual, check the manufacturer’s website. When all else fails, call a professional technician.</p>
