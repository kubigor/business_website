      "I was delighted with the scheduling and service provided by this company. The scheduling was done via text, simple! Igor came to the house the next day, and as I watched him work I realized how much GUNK was in the lines and nooks and crannies of my dishwasher. Disgusting! All better. Thank you.",

      "Very responsive from the start. I reached out on Friday when my dryer broke, by the end of the day they gave me a reasonable quote and ordered the part I needed. The part came in by Monday, and we scheduled them to come out on Wednesday (they were ready to come out Tuesday, but I couldn't make it work). Igor came right on schedule and was finished in the estimated time. Their quote came in the middle of the group, but it was their communication and easiness to work with that sold me. I highly recommend them for your appliance repair.",

      "What a fantastic and pleasant experience dealing with Igor at Major appliance repair. A very skilled and knowledgeable and polite technician who knows appliances really really well as far as troubleshooting them diagnosing a problem isolating the part that needs fixed and repairing the appliance by replacing the faulty component. I would recommend this company and Igor to anyone needing any appliance repair or maintenance.",

Rates were more than reasonable and he gave some great advice on whether a SubZero purchase was worth it in the long run. Highly recommend and Igor will be my go-to for any applicable repair!!",

      "Scheduled service through Igor and he was able to diagnose the issue within a few days, promptly ordered part and installed the next way. This was for a tenants appliance and he handled all scheduling directly with tenant after first diagnostic, adding further value to his very reasonable rate. Reliable, professional and fairly priced. Much better service than the repair subs I worked with through Bosch when the appliance was still under warranty. Couldn't ask for more and will be the first I call for any other appliance issues.",

      "Igor is the best! He responds quickly, he is punctual, polite and easy to deal with. Called him twice - for the dishwasher repair and for the gas range repair. He did great job both times, everything is working fine. Also he gives the best price possible (I mean really good price) as he does the work himself, no middleman involved. Highly recommend!",
