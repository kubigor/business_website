We only provide services under these waivers and our price is based on the customer accepting our waivers. By requesting that we perform the work, you are accepting our waivers. If one or part of these waivers is found to not be enforceable that will not prevent the remaining waivers from being enforced. Waiver of Damages When Moving Appliance You understand there is inherent risk in when moving appliances. There is risk of damage to the machine itself, and to areas surrounding its installation, including but not limited to flooring, cabinetry and counter tops. You acknowledge the technician is not required to move the appliance. In exchange for his willingness to do so, you promise to hold harmless both the technician and Major Appliance Repair from any and every liability associated with any such damage as may occur in connection with this movement. Waiver of Damages When Working with Water You understand the machinery that\\u2019s being worked on is connected with the building\\u2019s plumbing system, and whenever any machinery is so connected, there is an inherent risk that component failure, imperfect connections and/or other faults could result in unintended leakage and/or flooding within the building, causing significant and sometimes catastrophic damage. Excepting for cases of gross, clearly proven, and explicitly identifiable negligence by the technician, you promise to hold harmless both the technician and Major Appliance Repair, its principals, agents and employees from any and all damages, harms or liability that may result from such an occurrence. By allowing the technician to commence work, you explicitly waive the right to any contrary claim. Waiver of Damages from Failed Cooling Equipment You understand that, like any machinery, refrigeration equipment consists of a multiplicity of complex components, any of which can fail without warning, and that any effort to service and/or repair same carries inherent risks. Diagnoses are not always straightforward, and, even when carefully performed, repair this equipment and/or service work may involve imperfections that result in failure of the machinery to perform as intended. Such failures may lead to food spoilage, discomfort, inconvenience, and (particularly in commercial contexts) even loss of revenue as associated with canceled or failed events, inability to service customers, etc. You acknowledge that, by undertaking to service and/or repair your equipment, Major Appliance Repair is not accepting responsibility for any such risks. You agree all such risks are your own (and/or your company\\u2019s) alone, and you agree to hold harmless and exempt from liability Major Appliance Repair, it\\u2019s agents and employees from any and all such harms. By allowing the technician to commence work, you explicitly waive the right to any contrary claim. Waiver of Damages from Lifting Glass Cook Top You understand that, in lifting a glass/ceramic cook top surface to access components below it, there is an inherent risk of breakage. The top is attached with strong adhesive, and it is not always possible to achieve separation without the surface fracturing. While expecting the technician to exercise every due level of care, you nevertheless recognize that the Technician and Major Appliance Repair explicitly refrain from accepting any responsibility for these risks. You agree all such risks are your own (and/or your company\\u2019s) alone, and you agree to hold harmless and exempt from Major Appliance Repair, it\\u2019s agents and employees from any and all such responsibility.
